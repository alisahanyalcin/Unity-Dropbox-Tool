# Unity Dropbox Tool
This project is a remake? of the [UDT (DropboxTool)](https://github.com/xwbash/UDT/tree/main/DropboxTool) project.

If you have installed the dropbox application in a different directory than the default, you need to define the `destPath` variable on `line 17` from the `DropboxUpload.cs` file.

## Requirements
* To use this tool dropbox's windows app must be installed.

## Special thanks
* [xwbash](https://github.com/xwbash) for the original [UDT (DropboxTool)](https://github.com/xwbash/UDT/tree/main/DropboxTool) project.
